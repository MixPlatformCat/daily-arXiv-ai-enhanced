These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites."}

In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the \"modulated wiggle well,\" which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $μ$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting."}

Our analysis reveals a characteristic evolution of the wave-packet center of mass, which undergoes an initial acceleration, subsequently slows down, and ultimately enters a regime of uniform motion, accompanied throughout by exponential amplification of the wave-packet amplitude. To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the Hatano-Nelson chain. Our results elucidate the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity in generating unconventional transport phenomena, and pave the way for controlling wave dynamics in nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian metamaterials."}

A novel solution method based on conversion of hypersingular equations to a matrix operator is presented, which is general and can solve the equations of motion for submerged rigid, flexible elastic or flexible piezoelectric plates.

Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics."}

Molecule-intercalated TaS2 superlattices have recently been reported to host such states, yet their origin remains debated, underscoring the urgent need for controlled, device-integrated studies. Here, we report that nanometer-thick TaS2 and NbSe2 intercalated with chiral and achiral organic cations instead exhibit robust monolayer-like Ising superconductivity, with no evidence of unconventional pairing. Using high-quality superlattices integrated into devices, we disentangle the roles of interlayer coupling and charge transfer in shaping their superconducting behavior. In TaS2, intercalation induces interlayer decoupling regardless of molecular size or symmetry, yielding monolayer-like Ising superconductivity. NbSe2 instead retains quasi-three-dimensional transport, with a gradual Ising enhancement and near-monolayer behavior only at the largest interlayer spacing. Transport remains reciprocal across all superlattices, consistent with preserved inversion symmetry and incompatible with parity-breaking superconductivity and noncentrosymmetric monolayers. We attribute the behavior to electronically detached monolayers with opposite spin-split bands, coupled through thermal and tunneling processes, which overall preserve inversion symmetry. These findings establish molecular intercalation compounds as a robust, device-ready, platform for engineering advanced superconducting superlattices."}

Despite high optical limits in efficiency, progress in improving its device performance has been limited by severe voltage losses. Recent spectroscopic investigations suggest that self-trapping occurs in Sb2S3, limiting the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to a maximum of approximately 800 mV, which is the level the field has asymptotically approached. In this work, we surpass this voltage barrier through reductions in the defect density in Sb2S3 thin films by modulating the growth mechanism in chemical bath deposition using citrate ligand additives. Deep level transient spectroscopy identifies two deep traps 0.4-0.7 eV above the valence band maximum, and, through first-principles calculations, we identify these to likely be S vacancies, or Sb on S anti-sites. The concentrations of these traps are lowered by decreasing the grain boundary density from 1114+/-52 nm/um2 to 585+/-10 nm/um2, and we achieve a Voc of 824 mV, the record for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work addresses the debate in the field around whether Sb2S3 is limited by defects or self-trapping, showing that it is possible to improve the performance towards the radiative limit through careful defect engineering."}

Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses."}

Yet, a large fraction of reported KTaO3-based 2DEGs has been realized through chemically complex overlayers that both generate carriers and can obscure the native electronic structure, making spectroscopic access to the underlying 2DEG challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement. Transport measurements confirm a superconducting transition below 0.6 K. Together, these results demonstrate a chemically straightforward and controllable pathway for fabricating spectroscopically accessible superconducting 2DEGs on KTaO3(111), and provide a powerful new platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based oxide interfaces."}

Recently, the observation of charge transfer and interfacial polarons in superconducting interface has aroused extensive research interest. However, experimental data to investigate charge transfer on the CuO2 plane and the presence of polarons are still missing. Here we conduct extensive research on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional material supported on copper-based superconductors. Unlike monolayer-WSe2 on other substrates, monolayer-WSe2 on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (WSe2/LSCO) produces a special band structure. Using high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry and density functional theory calculation methods, the special electronic structure can be attributed to the formation of the interfacial small polaron at the WSe2/LSCO interface which is driven by charge transfer between the CuO2 plane of the cuprate superconductor and WSe2. In addition, the structural phase transition of the LSCO substrate was observed to reduce the electron-hole (e-h) interaction of WSe2. These findings may spur future investigations on the effect of the interfacial polaron on the superconductivity of cuprates, and highlight the significant influence of interface effects on the electronic structure of WSe2 films. It provides an effective method to further explore the intrinsic relationship between interfacial polarons and superconductivity."}

The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components."}

Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today."}

Here, we reveal two intertwined phenomena in AlO_x/KTaO_3 heterostructures: a gate-history memory in which progressive electrostatic cycling enhances the superconducting transition temperature, and its complete erasure by light illumination at cryogenic temperatures. These phenomena arise from a previously unrecognized interplay between the superconducting interface and emergent lattice excitations - including polar-nanoregion reorientation and oxygen-vacancy ionization.

While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential μ*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design."}

The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap.

It relies on the magnetocaloric effect, in which the temperature of a magnetic material changes in response to variations in an applied magnetic field. Optimal magnetocaloric materials are characterized by a significant change in magnetic entropy under moderate magnetic field. In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies.

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping.

However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters, and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics, each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model, but of limited utility if considered in isolation.

B 97, 024514 (2018)] within the first-principles calculations based on multiple scattering theory and the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) Green's function method. In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value. We also find a negligible induced triplet part, yet comparable to the induced singlet values, indicating some singlet-triplet mixing in the Mn layer/s."}

The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions."}

The aim was to investigate their magnetic properties, electronic structures, and spin-resolved longitudinal conductivity at finite temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) and functional integral theory were used. This approach incorporates transverse spin fluctuations through a disordered local moment method and the coherent potential approximation. In all cases, the calculated theoretical Curie temperatures were lower than the experimental values. Alloys with a B2 structures exhibit higher Curie temperatures compared to compounds with an L21 structures. Calculations of the temperature dependence of the density of states (DOS) indicate that the half-metallic electronic structure collapses owing to the renormalization of transverse spin fluctuations at a finite temperatures. However, the spin-resolved longitudinal conductivities demonstrated an improved spin polarization, particularly for Mn2VGa with an L21 structure. This result contradicts predictions based on the temperature-dependent DOS. The competition between the metallic transitions, which are caused by a modification of the DOS, and scattering coming from spin-disorder explains this phenomenon. Both of these effects are induced by transverse spin fluctuations. Additionally, the results show that half-metallicity, as defined by the DOS or conductivity, is inconsistent at finite temperatures. Finally, the total energy landscape of the paramagnetic state was calculated using the fixed spin moment method to investigate the strength of the longitudinal spin fluctuations. These results suggest that the alloys may exhibit strong longitudinal spin fluctuations."}

Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement.

The 5-nm-thick a-CFB film is capped with a W layer for comparison. The surface morphology is investigated by using the atomic force microscopy technique. The low roughness of all the surface of the film indicates uniformity, moderate corrosion resistance, and good structural quality. The X-ray diffraction spectra reveal the amorphous nature of the CFB layer, while the W capping is of mixed phase in the experimental thickness regime. In-plane and out-of-plane hysteresis loops obtained from the vibrating sample magnetometry technique show a transition from an upright S to nearly rectangular shape via a completely inverted profile. A self-sustained tilted magnetic anisotropy is stabilized in a seed-free environment based on the direct substrate-to-magnet interaction. The interface anisotropy is estimated to be 0.06 erg/cm2. The complex anisotropic behavior originates from the interplay between interface anisotropy, conventional shape anisotropy, growth-induced anisotropies, and inhomogeneity-induced anisotropies.

By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures."}

The RT-TDDFT-RSH implementation for periodic systems requires careful treatment of the Coulomb singularity and choosing proper gauges for the incorporation of external fields. We benchmark two schemes for treating the Coulomb singularity - the truncated Coulomb potential and the auxiliary-function correction - and find that the latter shows better convergence behavior and numerical stability for long-range corrected hybrid functions. Additionally, we assess the impact of gauge choice in simulations using numerical atomic orbitals and show that the recently proposed hybrid gauge incorporating position-dependent phases provides a more accurate description of excitonic absorption than the conventional velocity gauge. Our implementation significantly improves the accuracy of RT-TDDFT-RSH for modeling ultrafast excitonic dynamics in periodic systems."}

Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications."}

Here, by combining first-principles-based machine learning potentials with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the role of topological surface phonons in the in-plane thermal transport of semiconductor thin films (Si, 4H -SiC, and c-BN). These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity. Remarkably, for these thin semiconductor films below 10 nm this contribution can be as large as over 30% of the in-plane thermal conductivity at 300 K, and the largest absolute contribution can reach 82 W/m-K, highlighting their significant role in nanoscale thermal transport in semiconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both temperature and biaxial strain provide effective means to modulate this contribution. Our work establishes a direct link between topological surface phonons and nanoscale thermal transport, offering the first quantitative assessment of their role and paving the way for topology-enabled thermal management in semiconductors."}

This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the field dependent adsorption behavior of neutral saccharin and its deprotonated anion (saccharinate) on nickel. By employing the B3LYP functional and implicit solvent models, the field dependent adsorption energetics, frontier orbitals and electrostatic potentials are calculated on a nickel surface. Key findings reveal that while saccharinate dominates in bulk plating baths, its strong solvation shell impedes surface adsorption. In contrast, neutral saccharin exhibits energetically favorable adsorption via sulfonyl oxygen or aromatic $π$-face interactions, with specific orientations further stabilized by the interfacial field.This selective adsorption at growth sites rationalizes saccharin's role in inhibiting rapid crystallization, promoting grain refinement, and producing bright, level deposits.The results directly link field-modulated molecular stereochemistry to macroscopic coating properties, providing a mechanistic foundation for the rational design of electroplating additives beyond empirical approaches."}

While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups.

In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K.

We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Unambiguously identifying unconventional magnetic orders requires probes that are directly sensitive to their momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses."}

Recent experimental advances have enabled the confinement of water down to the nanometre scale, even to the single-molecule limit, yet how this process is altered at the extreme nanoconfinement remains unclear. Using \\emph{ab-initio} calculations and enhanced-sampling machine-learning potential molecular dynamics, we show that monolayer-confined water exhibits a markedly lower barrier to auto-dissociation than bulk water. Confinement restructures both intramolecular bonding and the intermolecular hydrogen-bond network, while enforcing quasi-2D dipolar correlations that amplify dielectric fluctuations. Our results imply that two-dimensional confined water could act as a \\emph{superdielectric} medium and may exhibit \\emph{superionic} behavior, as observed in recent experiments. These findings reveal confinement as a powerful route to enhanced proton activity, shedding light on geochemical niches, biomolecular environments, and nanofluidic systems where water's chemistry is fundamentally reshaped."}

Yet, a large fraction of reported KTaO3-based 2DEGs has been realized through chemically complex overlayers that both generate carriers and can obscure the native electronic structure, making spectroscopic access to the underlying 2DEG challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement. Transport measurements confirm a superconducting transition below 0.6 K. Together, these results demonstrate a chemically straightforward and controllable pathway for fabricating spectroscopically accessible superconducting 2DEGs on KTaO3(111), and provide a powerful new platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based oxide interfaces."}
