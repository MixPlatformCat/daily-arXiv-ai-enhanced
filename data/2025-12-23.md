Abstract: Gaining insight into the interaction between flexible piezoelectric structures and ocean waves can inform the development of compact, high-efficiency wave-energy converters that harvest renewable energy from the marine environment. In this paper, the problem of wave energy absorption by floating and submerged piezoelectric plates is investigated. The equations of motion for a plate consisting of two piezoelectric layers separated by an elastic substrate are derived in dimensional form from the full piezoelectric constitutive laws. A novel solution method based on conversion of hypersingular equations to a matrix operator is presented, which is general and can solve the equations of motion for submerged rigid, flexible elastic or flexible piezoelectric plates. Extensive numerical results are given for a range of parameters, including different piezoelectric materials: polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT-5H). Importantly, greater energy absorption is obtained for submerged plates when compared to plates floating on the surface. Furthermore, clamped boundary conditions give slightly larger energy absorption compared to the simply supported case.

Abstract: The present study provides the consideration of a mode III interface crack in one-dimentional (1D) piezoelectric quasicrystal under antiplane phonon and phason loading and inplane electric field. Due to complex function approach all required electromechanical parameters are presented through vector-functions analytic in the whole complex plane except the crack region. The cases of electrically impermeable (insulated) and electrically limited permeable conditions on the crack faces are considered. In the first case a vector Hilbert problem in the complex plane is formulated and solved exactly and in the second one the quadratic equation with respect to the electric flux through the crack region is obtained additionally. Its solution permits to find phonon and phason stresses, displacement jumps (sliding) and also electric characteristics along the material interface. Analytical formulas are also obtained for the corresponding stress intensity factors related to each field. The numerical computations for three selected variants of the loading conditions was conducted and the resulting field distributions are visualised on the crack continuation beyond the crack and also inside of the crack region.

Abstract: We review recent advances in Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in one- and two-dimensional materials. Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales.

Abstract: Sb2S3 is a promising material for low-toxicity, high-stability next-generation photovoltaics. Despite high optical limits in efficiency, progress in improving its device performance has been limited by severe voltage losses. Recent spectroscopic investigations suggest that self-trapping occurs in Sb2S3, limiting the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to a maximum of approximately 800 mV, which is the level the field has asymptotically approached. In this work, we surpass this voltage barrier through reductions in the defect density in Sb2S3 thin films by modulating the growth mechanism in chemical bath deposition using citrate ligand additives. Deep level transient spectroscopy identifies two deep traps 0.4-0.7 eV above the valence band maximum, and, through first-principles calculations, we identify these to likely be S vacancies, or Sb on S anti-sites. The concentrations of these traps are lowered by decreasing the grain boundary density from 1114+/-52 nm/um2 to 585+/-10 nm/um2, and we achieve a Voc of 824 mV, the record for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work addresses the debate in the field around whether Sb2S3 is limited by defects or self-trapping, showing that it is possible to improve the performance towards the radiative limit through careful defect engineering.

Abstract: The Coulomb potential at an interior ion in a finite crystal of size $p$ is given by a linear superposition of contributions from displacement vectors ${\mathbf r}=(x,y,z)$ to its neighbors. This additive structure underlies universal relationships among Madelung constants and applies to both standard periodic boundary conditions and alternative Clifford supercells. Each pairwise contribution decomposes into three physically distinct components: a periodic bulk term, a quadratic boundary term, and a finite-size correction whose leading order term is $[24r^4-40(x^4+y^4+z^4)]/[9\sqrt{3} (2p+1)^2]$ for cubic crystals with unit lattice constant. Combining this decomposition with linear superposition yields a rapidly convergent direct-summation scheme, accurate even at $p=1$ ($3^3$ unit cells), enabling hands-on calculations of Madelung constants for a wide range of ionic crystals.

Abstract: High-entropy materials have emerged as a promising class of catalysts, driven by their high configurational entropy originating from structural disorder in single-phase multicomponent systems. Despite their potential, the catalytic performance of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we present a simple solution-based combustion route to synthesize two low-cost, transition metal-rich multicationic oxides positioned in the medium-entropy (HEO-4) and high-entropy (HEO-5) regimes. Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data confirmed single-phase formation with a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure for both nanostructures.
  The morphology, particle size, and multicationic elemental distribution were investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic performance of the synthesized HEOs was evaluated in the hydrogenation of a series of nitrophenol derivatives. Notably, HEO-5 exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity ($k_{\mathrm{app}} \approx 0.5~\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, TOF $= 2.1 \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{mol\,g^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$), achieving rapid conversion of \emph{p}-nitrophenol compared to the medium-entropy oxide nanostructures ($k_{\mathrm{app}} \approx 0.02~\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, TOF $= 7.2 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{mol\,g^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$). Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the reaction, including the activation energy ($E_a$), enthalpy of activation ($ΔH^{\ddagger}$), Gibbs free energy of activation ($ΔG^{\ddagger}$), and entropy of activation ($ΔS^{\ddagger}$), were determined to gain mechanistic insight into the reduction process. This study opens new avenues for the rational design and facile synthesis of high-entropy oxide catalysts, highlighting their potential for efficient and sustainable large-scale amine production.

Abstract: Twistronics, which exploits moire modulation of lattice and electronic structures in twisted bilayers, has emerged as a powerful approach to engineer novel quantum states. Recent efforts have expanded beyond two dimensional van der Waals (vdWs) crystals to more complex, strongly correlated materials, where interfacial moire effects can dominate physical properties. Here we demonstrate a generalizable route to fabricate twisted bilayers of transition metal nitrides with vdWs like interfaces, using freestanding CrN membranes as a model system. Twisted bilayer CrN (tCrN) is realized by employing cubic alkaline earth metal monoxides as sacrificial layers, enabling the assembly of clean, controllable interfaces. Electron ptychography reveals well defined, periodic square moire superlattices in tCrN. For a twist angle of 16.3 degree, we identify a nearly commensurate moire lattice with coincident Cr columns, whereas at 45 degree we uncover localized octagonal quasicrystalline order with clear self-similarity. These results establish a practical platform for twisted TMNs and open avenues to explore moire-induced atomic configurations and emergent correlated phenomena in nitride based heterostructures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Antiperovskite nitrides (X3AN) are the structural analogues to perovskite oxides, while their epitaxial growth and electronic properties remain largely unexplored. We report the successful synthesis of Ni3InN thin films on substrates with different lattice constants. First-principles phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of cubic phase Ni3InN, providing the basis for epitaxial synthesis. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals coherent (001)-oriented interfaces when Ni3InN is grown on LaAlO3 and SrTiO3, while an unexpected (011)-orientation forms on DyScO3, aligning with surface-energy predictions. Transport measurements highlight a strain-controlled Fermi-liquid behavior, correlated with variations in the Ni-3d bandwidth and hybridization. Band structure calculations reveal a dual character near the Fermi level: a high-mobility Dirac-like band and a Ni-3d manifold that drives strange-metal transport with a reduced slope compared to oxide perovskites. The formal Ni valence (+2/3) places Ni3InN in an overdoped correlated-metal regime, distinguishing from most perovskite oxides. This positions antiperovskite nitrides as a promising platform for investigating overdoped Fermi liquids and strange-metal behavior.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Material scientists and condensed matter physicists have long been divided on the issue of choosing the conceptual framework for explaining why open-shell transition-metal oxides tend to be insulators, whereas otherwise successful theories such as DFT often predict them to be (false) metals. Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction is a fundamental problem in materials science. We present CrystalFormer-CSP, an efficient framework that unifies data-driven heuristic and physics-driven optimization approaches to predict stable crystal structures for given chemical compositions. The approach combines pretrained generative models for space-group-informed structure generation and a universal machine learning force field for energy minimization. Reinforcement fine-tuning can be employed to further boost the accuracy of the framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrystalFormer-CSP on benchmark problems and showcase its usage via web interface and language model integration.

Abstract: Magnetic refrigeration presents an energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternative to traditional vapour-compression cooling technologies. It relies on the magnetocaloric effect, in which the temperature of a magnetic material changes in response to variations in an applied magnetic field. Optimal magnetocaloric materials are characterized by a significant change in magnetic entropy under moderate magnetic field. In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies. The magnetic transition temperatures predicted through Monte-Carlo simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Our results provide a unified microscopic understanding of magnetocaloric performance and magneto-optical activity in Mn-based pnictides and establish a reliable computational framework for designing next-generation magnetic refrigeration materials.

Abstract: The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters, and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics, each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model, but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes.

Abstract: First-principles studies were performed on two Mn-based ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds with L21 and B2 structures, that is, Mn2VZ (Z = Al or Ga). The aim was to investigate their magnetic properties, electronic structures, and spin-resolved longitudinal conductivity at finite temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) and functional integral theory were used. This approach incorporates transverse spin fluctuations through a disordered local moment method and the coherent potential approximation. In all cases, the calculated theoretical Curie temperatures were lower than the experimental values. Alloys with a B2 structures exhibit higher Curie temperatures compared to compounds with an L21 structures. Calculations of the temperature dependence of the density of states (DOS) indicate that the half-metallic electronic structure collapses owing to the renormalization of transverse spin fluctuations at a finite temperatures. However, the spin-resolved longitudinal conductivities demonstrated an improved spin polarization, particularly for Mn2VGa with an L21 structure. This result contradicts predictions based on the temperature-dependent DOS. The competition between the metallic transitions, which are caused by a modification of the DOS, and scattering coming from spin-disorder explains this phenomenon. Both of these effects are induced by transverse spin fluctuations. Additionally, the results show that half-metallicity, as defined by the DOS or conductivity, is inconsistent at finite temperatures. Finally, the total energy landscape of the paramagnetic state was calculated using the fixed spin moment method to investigate the strength of the longitudinal spin fluctuations. These results suggest that the alloys may exhibit strong longitudinal spin fluctuations.

Abstract: Thin amorphous-CoFeB (a-CFB) is deposited by rf-magnetron sputtering on a self-oxidized Si (100) substrate with different film thicknesses ranging from 0.7 nm to 20 nm. The 5-nm-thick a-CFB film is capped with a W layer for comparison. The surface morphology is investigated by using the atomic force microscopy technique. The low roughness of all the surface of the film indicates uniformity, moderate corrosion resistance, and good structural quality. The X-ray diffraction spectra reveal the amorphous nature of the CFB layer, while the W capping is of mixed phase in the experimental thickness regime. In-plane and out-of-plane hysteresis loops obtained from the vibrating sample magnetometry technique show a transition from an upright S to nearly rectangular shape via a completely inverted profile. A self-sustained tilted magnetic anisotropy is stabilized in a seed-free environment based on the direct substrate-to-magnet interaction. The interface anisotropy is estimated to be 0.06 erg/cm2. The complex anisotropic behavior originates from the interplay between interface anisotropy, conventional shape anisotropy, growth-induced anisotropies, and inhomogeneity-induced anisotropies. In essence, effective anisotropy is responsible for the anomalous hysteresis behavior observed in these films, and this work might provide valuable insights to improve the functionalities of amorphous soft magnetic alloys.

Abstract: Quasicrystals, structures that are ordered yet aperiodic, defy conventional band theory, confining most studies to finite-size real-space numerics. We overcome this limitation with a configuration-space framework that predicts and explains the positions and origins of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials. We find that a hierarchy of gaps stems from resonant hybridization between increasingly distant neighboring sites, pinning the integrated density of states below these gaps to specific irrational areas in configuration space. Large-scale simulations of a lowest-band tight-binding model built from localized Wannier functions show excellent agreement with these predictions. By moving beyond finite-size numerics, this study advances the understanding of quasicrystalline potentials, paving the way for new explorations of their quantum properties in the infinite-size limit.

Abstract: The emergence of the orbital degree of freedom in modern orbitronics offers a promising alternative to heavy metals for the efficient control of magnetization. In this context, identifying interfaces that exhibit orbital-momentum locking and an orbital Rashba-Edelstein response to an external electric field is of primary importance. In this work, we experimentally investigate the Co/Al system and extend the study to Co/Pt/Al structures. We show that inserting ultrathin Pt layers between Co and Al can significantly modify the orbital properties, highlighting the critical role of Co/Al orbital bonding in generating orbital polarization. We further model the orbital response of these systems using semi-phenomenological approaches and linear-response theory within the framework of density-functional theory.

Abstract: We synthezised an AlZnMgCu alloy through mechanical alloying and, using Xray diffraction (XRD), identified the formation of the eta prime phase after 40 hours of grinding. Using reaction-free isoconversion theory, we determined that this phase exhibits two different behaviours depending on the heating rate (beta): the eta prime phase at low beta and the eta phase at high beta.The activation energy values at low beta are consistent with the diffusion energies of copper, zinc and magnesium in aluminium. Significant qualitative and quantitative differences in the thermodynamic barriers (Delta H, Delta G and Delta S) are observed for beta values above or below 20 deg C min minus 1.

Abstract: Using a combination of band representation analysis, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements, and linear spin wave theory, we establish that the non-coplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological nodal lines, Weyl points, and a three-fold degeneracy in its magnon band structure. The non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering protects the topological magnon nodal lines that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of specific symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. Zero-field INS measurements confirm the existence of the topological magnon nodal lines through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines, indicating the non-trivial topology of the magnon wavefunctions. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, allowing further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems, and highlighting the rich interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Barocaloric (BC) effects at liquid-vapor transitions in hydrofluorocarbons drive most commercial technologies used for heating and cooling in the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning sector. However, these fluids suffer from huge global warming potential and alternative gases are less efficient, toxic or flammable. Solid-solid and solid-liquid BC materials have zero global warming potential and could even improve on current device efficiencies. Whilst solid-liquid BCs typically outperform solid-solid BCs, the latter are advantageous as they avoid leaks and present easier handling and recyclability thus facilitating waste management. Here we confine the solid-liquid BC stearic acid inside the nanopores of a functionalised metal-organic framework (MOF) and demonstrate that the colossal BC properties are retained in a solid-state material. Moreover, the enhanced interactions between the pore surface and the BC material allow a level of active control over the thermal response, as opposed to passive encapsulation. Our results open novel avenues to exploit and tune colossal BC effects in a wide range of combinations of solid-liquid BC materials embedded within functionalized MOFs, without the associated engineering drawbacks.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) driven discovery of novel and efficient thermoelectric (TE) materials warrants experimental TE datasets of high volume, diversity, and quality. While the largest publicly available dataset, Starrydata2, has a high data volume, it contains inaccurate data due to the inherent limitations of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted data curation, ambiguous nomenclature and complex formulas of materials in the literature. Another unaddressed issue is the inclusion of multi-source experimental data, with high standard deviations and without synthesis information. Using half-Heusler (hH) materials as an example, this work is aimed at first highlighting these errors and inconsistencies which cannot be filtered with conventional dataset curation workflows. We then propose a statistical round-robin error-based data filtering method to address these issues, a method that can be applied to filter any other material property. Lastly, a hybrid dataset creation workflow, involving data from Starrydata2 and manual extraction, is proposed and the resulting dataset is analyzed and compared against Starrydata2.

However, most existing RT-TDDFT studies rely on adiabatic local or semi-local approximations, which suffer from several shortcomings, including the inability to accurately capture excitonic effects in periodic systems. Combining RT-TDDFT with range-separated hybrid (RSH) functionals has emerged as an effective strategy to overcome these limitations. The RT-TDDFT-RSH implementation for periodic systems requires careful treatment of the Coulomb singularity and choosing proper gauges for the incorporation of external fields. We benchmark two schemes for treating the Coulomb singularity - the truncated Coulomb potential and the auxiliary-function correction - and find that the latter shows better convergence behavior and numerical stability for long-range corrected hybrid functions. Additionally, we assess the impact of gauge choice in simulations using numerical atomic orbitals and show that the recently proposed hybrid gauge incorporating position-dependent phases provides a more accurate description of excitonic absorption than the conventional velocity gauge. Our implementation significantly improves the accuracy of RT-TDDFT-RSH for modeling ultrafast excitonic dynamics in periodic systems.

Abstract: Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.

Abstract: While phonon topology in crystalline solids has been extensively studied, its influence on thermal transport-especially in nanostructures-remains elusive. Here, by combining first-principles-based machine learning potentials with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the role of topological surface phonons in the in-plane thermal transport of semiconductor thin films (Si, 4H -SiC, and c-BN). These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity. Remarkably, for these thin semiconductor films below 10 nm this contribution can be as large as over 30% of the in-plane thermal conductivity at 300 K, and the largest absolute contribution can reach 82 W/m-K, highlighting their significant role in nanoscale thermal transport in semiconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both temperature and biaxial strain provide effective means to modulate this contribution. Our work establishes a direct link between topological surface phonons and nanoscale thermal transport, offering the first quantitative assessment of their role and paving the way for topology-enabled thermal management in semiconductors.

Abstract: The realization of long-range spin order in two-dimensions (2D) has catapulted the search for layered materials with magnetic ordering above room temperature. These efforts aim to understand and enhance the spin spin interactions in 2D. An emergent class of such magnets is the layered FeNGeTe2 (N = 3, 4, and 5). Here, we investigate the magnetic states over a wide field temperature phase space in the high-Tc ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using magnetization, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and magneto-transport measurements. Our findings reveal a magnetic phase transition from a collinear to a complex non-collinear magnetic order near the temperature T* = 160 K, below which magnetic susceptibility is reduced, FMR linewidth broadened, and anomalous Hall resistivity suppressed. Such non-collinearity results from the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction arising from the unusual Fe1 ordering in two possible split sites. Our study focuses on the strategy to quench the non-collinear spin order. Substituting 40% Ni in Fe5GeTe2 is found to be one such quenching strategy. This provides deeper insights into the magnetism of a high-Tc layered-ferromagnet, offering opportunities to develop 2D magnet-based devices.

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enable magnetic property engineering via intercalation, but stoichiometry-structure-magnetism correlations remain poorly defined for Fe-intercalated $\mathrm{NbSe_2}$. Here, we report a systematic study of $\mathrm{Fe}_{x}\mathrm{NbSe_2}$ across an extended composition range $0.05 \le x \le 0.38$, synthesized via chemical vapor transport and verified by rigorous energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) microanalysis. X-ray diffraction, magnetic, and transport measurements reveal an intrinsic correlation between Fe content, structural ordering, and magnetic ground states. With increasing $x$, the system undergoes a successive transition from paramagnetism to a spin-glass state, then to long-range antiferromagnetism (AFM), and ultimately to a reentrant spin-glass phase, with the transition temperatures exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on Fe content. The maximum Néel temperature ($T_{\mathrm{N}}$ = $\mathrm{175K}$) and strongest AFM coupling occur at $x=0.25$, where Fe atoms form a well-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0 $ superlattice within van der Waals gaps. Beyond $x = 0.25$, the superlattice transforms or disorders, weakening Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions and reducing $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ significantly. Electrical transport exhibits distinct anomalies at magnetic transition temperatures, corroborating the magnetic state evolution. Our work extends the compositional boundary of Fe-intercalated $\mathrm{NbSe_2}$, establishes precise stoichiometry-structure-magnetism correlations, and identifies structural ordering as a key tuning parameter for AFM. These findings provide a quantitative framework for engineering altermagnetic or switchable antiferromagnetic states in van der Waals materials.

Abstract: In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.

Abstract: The strain-relaxation mechanism of a set of Si$_{0.6}$Ge$_{0.4}$ linearly graded buffers (LGBs), grown following different temperature profiles, has been investigated by means of defect-etching and variable-temperature high-resolution X-ray diffraction (VT-HRXRD). Defect-etching experiments demonstrate that a sharp increase of threading dislocation density (TDD) from $3 \times 10^{5}$\,cm$^{-2}$ to $1.2 \times 10^{6}$\,cm$^{-2}$ takes place when the final growth temperature exceeds a critical value T$_c\approx 530^\circ$C. VT-HRXRD measurements show that in low TDD samples extra relaxation takes place for annealing temperatures larger than T$_c$, thanks to the nucleation of new dislocations. These results indicate that, below T$_c$, strain relaxation is driven by the gliding of existing dislocations while above T$_c$ new dislocations are nucleated, suggesting a link with our results and the brittle-to-ductile transition in Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ alloys.

Abstract: Experimental data on the specific heat $C_p$ of quadruple perovskites ACu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ (A = Mn, Cu, La, Ce, Dy) are presented, demonstrating an anomalous concave-down $C_p/T$ vs. $T^2$ curve and a bell-shaped feature in $β(T) = (C_p - γT)/T^3$ plotted against $T$ on a logarithmic scale. This feature is most pronounced for A = Cu and Mn. These findings can be explained by the rattling phenomenon, previously identified in other systems such as filled skutterudites and $β$-pyrochlores. Using first-principles DFT+U calculations, the presence of a rattling mode in A = Mn system is directly confirmed. A qualitative interpretation of the rattling mechanism in terms of a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect is proposed.

Abstract: Magnetic two-dimensional (2D) crystals were isolated about a decade ago, triggering a tremendous research activity worldwide. This colloquium raises a stiff question: what is really new about them? At first sight, they seem to be purer implementations of 2D spin models than traditional systems such as ultra-thin films. Yet, they partly realized their promises so far, and whether they give fresh perspectives on long-standing predictions in statistical physics is still an open question. Undoubtedly, they are uniquely amenable to electric-field effect, susceptible to mechanical deformation, and sensitive to moirés, for example. They represent interesting platforms for exploring, challenging, or simply revisiting a wide range of phenomena in condensed matter magnetism. This colloquium intends to offer a critical, yet not necessarily skeptical, overview of the field, clarifying what we believe could be unique with 2D magnets, related quasi-2D van der Waals magnets, and their heterostructures.

Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.

Abstract: The effects of uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain on the $ρ_{xx}$ and $ρ_{yy}$ components of the resistivity tensor, and the commensurable-nearly commensurate CDW (CCDW-NCCDW) transition temperature in 1T-TaS$_2$ are studied. At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one. The results allow to justify various models widely used in analysis of transport properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ in commensurate and nearly commensurate states.

Abstract: Energy conversion in AZ31B magnesium alloy depends strongly on the dominant deformation mechanism. In slip-dominated specimen, strained parallel to extrusion direction $\parallel$ ED, approximately 50$\%$ of plastic work is converted into heat, with Taylor-Quinney coefficient $β_{int}$ rising rapidly then gradually with strain. Twinning-dominated specimen ($\perp$ ED) initially stores most plastic work, showing minimal heat dissipation, reflecting the dislocation-mediated nature of twinning in HCP metals, and $β_{int}$ increasing to $\approx$ 0.4 at failure. The final microstructure tracks stored energy evolution: the $\parallel$ ED specimen, predominantly slip-dominated, exhibits fragmented grains and strong dislocation activity, with twinning appearing at the final stages, driving energy accumulation and lattice rotation. In contrast, the $\perp$ ED specimen shows limited refinement, early localization, and twinning-driven premature fracture.

Abstract: ScN alloyed AlN (ScxAl1-xN, ScAlN) is a wurtzite semiconductor with attractive ferroelectric, dielectric, piezoelectric, and optical properties. Here, we show that ScAlN films (with x spanning 0.18 to 0.36) contain nanoscale Sc-rich clusters which maintain the wurtzite crystal structure. While both molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and sputter deposited Sc0.3Al0.7N films show Sc clustering, the degree of clustering is significantly stronger for the MBE-grown film, offering an explanation for some of the discrepancies between MBE-grown and sputtered films reported in the literature. Moreover, the MBE-grown Sc0.3Al0.7N film exhibits a dispersive and anomalously large dielectric permittivity, roughly double that of sputtered Sc0.3Al0.7N. We attribute this result to the Sc-rich clusters locally reaching x ~ 0.5 and approaching the predicted ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, resulting in a giant (local) enhancement in permittivity. The Sc-rich clusters should similarly affect the piezoelectric, optical, and ferroelectric responses, suggesting cluster-engineering as a means to tailor ScAlNs functional properties.

Abstract: High-temperature and high-magnetic-field-induced re-entrant superconductivity has been discovered in the infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{Sm_{1-x-y} Eu_x Ca_y Ni O_2}$ (SECNO). Infinite-layer nickelates are the closest known analogues of high-$\mathrm{T}_c$ cuprate superconductors, yet they host distinct magnetic ground states. Using low-energy muon spin relaxation and polarized neutron reflectometry, we reveal the magnetic order in SECNO. We find that magnetic freezing occurs at a higher-temperature than in other nickelate compounds, and that a substantial net magnetization of 55 $\,\mathrm{kA}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ $\pm10 \,\mathrm{kA}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ emerges and remains largely unchanged across the superconducting transition. The magnetism in SECNO is disordered and nonuniform.

Abstract: Engineering unconventional superconductors is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Molecule-intercalated TaS2 superlattices have recently been reported to host such states, yet their origin remains debated, underscoring the urgent need for controlled, device-integrated studies. Here, we report that nanometer-thick TaS2 and NbSe2 intercalated with chiral and achiral organic cations instead exhibit robust monolayer-like Ising superconductivity, with no evidence of unconventional pairing. Using high-quality superlattices integrated into devices, we disentangle the roles of interlayer coupling and charge transfer in shaping their superconducting behavior. In TaS2, intercalation induces interlayer decoupling regardless of molecular size or symmetry, yielding monolayer-like Ising superconductivity. NbSe2 instead retains quasi-three-dimensional transport, with a gradual Ising enhancement and near-monolayer behavior only at the largest interlayer spacing. Transport remains reciprocal across all superlattices, consistent with preserved inversion symmetry and incompatible with parity-breaking superconductivity and noncentrosymmetric monolayers. We attribute the behavior to electronically detached monolayers with opposite spin-split bands, coupled through thermal and tunneling processes, which overall preserve inversion symmetry. These findings establish molecular intercalation compounds as a robust, device-ready, platform for engineering advanced superconducting superlattices.

Abstract: In quantum materials, charge orders typically stabilize in specific crystallographic orientations, though their formation mechanisms may vary. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we discover a lattice-decoupled rotatable stripe-like charge order coexisting with superconductivity in 2M-WS2. The charge order manifests five distinct orientations across different sample regions, yet maintains an identical wavelength. This directional decoupling from host lattice challenges existing paradigms. First-principles calculations of phonon spectra and nesting function fail to explain the ordering mechanism. Intriguingly, the transition temperature of the charge orders exhibits spatial variations (21-46 K), coinciding with the temperature range of the recently reported strange metal phase in this material. This correlation suggests that the interplay between strong electronic correlations and electron-phonon coupling must be critically evaluated to elucidate the emergence of this unconventional charge order.

Abstract: We study the surface density of states in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems ($p$-wave unconventional magnetic superconductors), by using the effective model [B. Brekke, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236703 (2024)]. Owing to the noncollinear spin structure along the $x$-direction, the quasiparticle energy dispersion has the spin-triplet $p_x$-wave energy gap structure, and then zero-energy flat bands emerge at the [100] edge. Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains. We also demonstrate the Josephson current in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnet-conventional $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems. By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge. Our calculations provide the possible superconducting phenomena and transport properties in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-$s$-wave SC hybrid systems.

Abstract: Niobium and its alloys with early transition metals have been extensively studied for their excellent superconducting properties. They have high transition temperatures, strong upper critical fields, and high critical current densities, making them ideal for superconducting applications such as SQUIDs, MRI, NMR, particle accelerators, and Qubits. Here we report a systematic investigation of as-cast Nb-rich alloys, Nb$_{0.85}$X$_{0.15}$ (X = Ti, Zr, Hf), using magnetization, electrical transport, and specific heat measurements. They exhibit strong type-II bulk superconductivity with moderate superconducting transition temperatures and upper critical fields. The estimated magnetic field-dependent critical current density lies in the range of 10$^5$--10$^6$~A/cm$^2$ across various temperatures, while the corresponding flux-pinning force density is on the order of GNm$^{-3}$, suggesting the potential of these materials for practical applications. Electronic-specific heat data reveal a strongly coupled, single, isotropic, nodeless superconducting gap. These Nb-rich alloys, characterized by robust superconducting properties, hold significant potential for applications in superconducting device technologies.

Abstract: Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at the surfaces of KTaO3 have become an exciting platform for exploring strong spin-orbit coupling, Rashba physics, and low-carrier-density superconductivity. Yet, a large fraction of reported KTaO3-based 2DEGs has been realized through chemically complex overlayers that both generate carriers and can obscure the native electronic structure, making spectroscopic access to the underlying 2DEG challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement. Transport measurements confirm a superconducting transition below 0.6 K. Together, these results demonstrate a chemically straightforward and controllable pathway for fabricating spectroscopically accessible superconducting 2DEGs on KTaO3(111), and provide a powerful new platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based oxide interfaces.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the possible emergence of superconducting phases in a multi-Weyl semimetal. In particular, we show that the presence of a pair of Weyl nodes with chirality $|ν| \ge 1$ leads to an effective description of the intra-nodal pairings in terms of monopole harmonics, in contrast to inter-nodal pairings that preserve the angular dependence of conventional spherical harmonics. Therefore, we explore the conditions for the competition and/or coexistence between both types of superconducting phases, and we identify the presence of the so-called "topological repulsion" mechanism, which was previously reported in the context of simple Weyl semimetals. We identified the critical temperatures corresponding to the monopole and conventional superconducting phases, and calculated the specific heat as a function of temperature, thus showing that this thermodynamical parameter may provide an experimental probe to determine the chirality index $ν$ in the material.

Abstract: Understanding the electronic properties of doped copper-oxygen planes remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics and is crucial to unraveling the mechanisms behind high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Recently, the observation of charge transfer and interfacial polarons in superconducting interface has aroused extensive research interest. However, experimental data to investigate charge transfer on the CuO2 plane and the presence of polarons are still missing. Here we conduct extensive research on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional material supported on copper-based superconductors. Unlike monolayer-WSe2 on other substrates, monolayer-WSe2 on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (WSe2/LSCO) produces a special band structure. Using high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry and density functional theory calculation methods, the special electronic structure can be attributed to the formation of the interfacial small polaron at the WSe2/LSCO interface which is driven by charge transfer between the CuO2 plane of the cuprate superconductor and WSe2. In addition, the structural phase transition of the LSCO substrate was observed to reduce the electron-hole (e-h) interaction of WSe2. These findings may spur future investigations on the effect of the interfacial polaron on the superconductivity of cuprates, and highlight the significant influence of interface effects on the electronic structure of WSe2 films. It provides an effective method to further explore the intrinsic relationship between interfacial polarons and superconductivity.

Abstract: Realizing non-volatile control of superconductivity is a key step toward integrating memory and quantum functionality in future information technologies. KTaO_3-based heterostructures uniquely host both interfacial two-dimensional superconductivity and a quantum paraelectric lattice background. The coupling between these two degrees of freedom potentially provides a promising route to encode memory directly into the superconducting state. Here, we reveal two intertwined phenomena in AlO_x/KTaO_3 heterostructures: a gate-history memory in which progressive electrostatic cycling enhances the superconducting transition temperature, and its complete erasure by light illumination at cryogenic temperatures. These phenomena arise from a previously unrecognized interplay between the superconducting interface and emergent lattice excitations - including polar-nanoregion reorientation and oxygen-vacancy ionization. These results demonstrate reconfigurable and non-volatile superconductivity at correlated oxide interfaces, opening a pathway to combine dissipationless transport with non-volatility for superconducting neuromorphic elements.

Abstract: More than a century after discovery, the theory of conventional superconductivity remains incomplete. While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential μ*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design.

Abstract: Motivated by recent reports of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films grown on LaSrAlO$_4$, we investigate the superconducting instability in a one-unit cell thin film using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\it within} the $γ$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of magnetic order on the proximity-induced superconducting state in the Mn layers of a Mn-Nb(110) heterostructure by using a first-principles method. For this study, we use the recently developed Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) solver for superconducting heterostructures [Csire et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 024514 (2018)] within the first-principles calculations based on multiple scattering theory and the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) Green's function method. In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value. We also find a negligible induced triplet part, yet comparable to the induced singlet values, indicating some singlet-triplet mixing in the Mn layer/s.

Abstract: MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils are ultimately limited by conductor loss, thermal noise, and reciprocity constraints associated with conventional metallic boundary conditions. These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites.

Abstract: The notoriously low and fluctuating valley splitting is one of the key challenges for electron spin qubits in silicon (Si), limiting the scalability of Si-based quantum processors. In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the "modulated wiggle well," which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $μ$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting.

Abstract: In this article, we explain the reason of the apparent contradiction between recent experiments [1] and [2] and earlier theoretical predictions [3] of strongly asymmetric condensate resulting in attractive interaction between the condensate magnons. We show that the relaxation time for equilibrium between two condensates at two minima of energy exceeds the time of experiment. Therefore, it should be described by Boltzmann kinetic equation. We develop the proper kinetic theory and find the relation between the critical pumping power and the effective temperature of over-condensate magnons.

Abstract: The time evolution of initially localized wavepackets in the discrete Hatano-Nelson lattice displays a rich dynamical structure shaped by the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity. Our analysis reveals a characteristic evolution of the wave-packet center of mass, which undergoes an initial acceleration, subsequently slows down, and ultimately enters a regime of uniform motion, accompanied throughout by exponential amplification of the wave-packet amplitude. To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the Hatano-Nelson chain. Our results elucidate the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity in generating unconventional transport phenomena, and pave the way for controlling wave dynamics in nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian metamaterials.

Abstract: Plasmons in atomically thin materials offer a compelling route to trigger nonlinear light-matter interactions through extreme optical confinement in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. However, optical nonlocality in plasmons is typically associated with losses in the linear response regime. Here, we show that nonlocal effects mediate strong plasmon-assisted optical nonlinearity in electrically reconfigurable 2D heterostructures. Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.

Abstract: Amorphous oxide tunneling barriers, primarily formed from aluminum, represent one of the most widely adopted platforms for superconducting quantum bits (qubits). To overcome challenges associated with defects and sample variance among the tunneling barriers, the methodology of alternating bias assisted annealing (ABAA) was introduced in Pappas et. al[1]. The process of applying alternating bias to the barrier and subsequently aging before use was shown to reduce defects in the barrier. Namely, defects that give rise to two-level systems, coupling to the qubit and expediting decoherence. In this work we replicate an expedited ABAA process through a combination of ab-initio molecular dynamics and machine-learned potentials, illuminating how ABAA effects the energy landscape of the barrier.

Abstract: We develop a general multipolar theory of strong spin-orbit coupling for large total angular momentum $j$ in time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.

Abstract: Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.

Abstract: Unambiguously identifying unconventional magnetic orders requires probes that are directly sensitive to their momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses.

Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes offer a controlled setting to study correlated magnetism emerging from $π$-electron systems. We analyze oligo(indenoindene) molecules, non-bipartite carbon ladders whose tight-binding spectra feature a gapped, weakly dispersing manifold of quasi-zero modes, and show that their low-energy properties can be effectively mapped onto an interacting set of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom. Using Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the full Fermi-Hubbard model, we obtain their excitation spectra, entanglement profiles, and spin-spin correlations. We then construct optimized delocalized fermionic modes that act as emergent spins and show that their interactions are well described by a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain. This effective description clarifies how spin degrees of freedom arise and interact in non-bipartite nanographene ladders, providing a compact and accurate representation of their correlated behavior.

Abstract: Water's ability to self-dissociate into H$_3$O$^+$ and OH$^-$ ions is central to acid-base chemistry and bioenergetics. Recent experimental advances have enabled the confinement of water down to the nanometre scale, even to the single-molecule limit, yet how this process is altered at the extreme nanoconfinement remains unclear. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations and enhanced-sampling machine-learning potential molecular dynamics, we show that monolayer-confined water exhibits a markedly lower barrier to auto-dissociation than bulk water. Confinement restructures both intramolecular bonding and the intermolecular hydrogen-bond network, while enforcing quasi-2D dipolar correlations that amplify dielectric fluctuations. Our results imply that two-dimensional confined water could act as a \emph{superdielectric} medium and may exhibit \emph{superionic} behavior, as observed in recent experiments. These findings reveal confinement as a powerful route to enhanced proton activity, shedding light on geochemical niches, biomolecular environments, and nanofluidic systems where water's chemistry is fundamentally reshaped.

Abstract: Thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold surfaces are one of the fundamental building blocks of molecular electronics. The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) has recently been observed in various systems, sparking interest in novel superconducting devices and offering a new platform to probe intrinsic material properties. Josephson junctions with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling have exhibited nonreciprocal critical currents under applied magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate the SDE in Josephson junctions incorporating periodic hole arrays patterned into the superconducting leads on InAs heterostructures with epitaxial aluminum. We observe an enhanced diode effect when a top gate depletes the 2DEG in the region of the hole arrays, while preserving the overall supercurrent. Theoretical analysis shows that the physics behind this phenomenon is the increased difference of transparency between different bands in the junction. These results highlight a new pathway for engineering and controlling nonreciprocal superconducting transport in hybrid systems.

Abstract: We investigated the anomalous Hall conductivity induced in silicon by circularly polarized light at room temperature using near-infrared (NIR) pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy. The time-resolved detection scheme eliminates the large nonlinear current generated by the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect, allowing exclusive observation of a long-lived anomalous Hall conductivity of photocarriers that depends on the helicity of NIR light. The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap. These results suggest the emergence of the inverse orbital Hall effect, paving the way for silicon-based orbitronics.

They can act as quasi-particles that can be generated, manipulated and annihilated, and hold promise for future memory and logic devices. As of now, all-optical stochastic nucleation of skyrmion ensembles, mostly in small applied magnetic fields, has been shown. However, to research their true potential, the ability to selectively toggle switch individual single skyrmions would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we demonstrate the field-free optical control of single stable skyrmions via single femtosecond laser pulses with diameters down to 175 nm, containing a fixed chirality. By engineering ferrimagnetic Co/Gd-based multilayers, we resolve the competition between deterministic and stochastic processes, and thereby overcome the challenge of optically writing and annihilating sub-micron skyrmions on demand. Our work is envisioned to fuel applications of skyrmion-based applications and opens up further endeavors in research related to the behaviour of more complicated skyrmion-based textures.

Abstract: We present a theory of resonance fluorescence (RF) of a solid-state quantum emitter in the regime of weak optical excitation. The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions.

Abstract: Hole-spin qubits enable fast, all-electrical spin manipulation through electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), arising from two microscopic mechanisms rooted in their intrinsically strong spin-orbit interaction. Depending on how the electric field acts on the quantum dot, the spin can be driven either by a modulation of its g-factor or by a displacement of the wavefunction. Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance.

Abstract: Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.

Abstract: In Si quantum dot systems, large magnetic field gradients are needed to implement spin rotations via electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR). By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures.

Abstract: We demonstrate that nontrivial multiband topological invariants of electronic wavefunctions can be revealed through diamagnetic orbital magnetization responses to external magnetic fields. We find that decomposing orbital magnetization into energetic and quantum-geometric contributions allows one to deduce nontrivial multiband topology, provided knowledge of the energy spectrum. We showcase our findings in general effective models with multiband Euler topology. We moreover identify such multiband topological invariants in effective models of strontium ruthenide ($\text{Sr}_2 \text{Ru} \text{O}_4$), which may in principle be verified in the state-of-the-art doping-dependent magnetization measurements. Our reconstruction scheme for multiband invariants sheds a topological perspective on the multiorbital effects in materials realizing unconventional phenomenologies of orbital currents or multiband superconductivity.
